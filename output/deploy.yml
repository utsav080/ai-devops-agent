Generate a GitHub Actions workflow (deploy.yml) that:
- Builds Docker image from Dockerfile
- Pushes to Docker Hub
- Deploys to staging

Summary:

You are an expert DevOps engineer.

The following is a software release description and a piece of code.

Your job is to:
1. Summarize what the code does in plain English.
2. Identify key deployment-relevant features (e.g., use of Flask, JWT, SQLAlchemy).
3. Suggest how such a backend could be deployed.

### Release Notes:
This file simulates a basic Flask backend API and includes:

A JWT-protected endpoint.

A reference to a SQLAlchemy model (User).

Basic token validation.

### Code:
# backend/app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from models import User
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not token or not validate_token(token):
        return jsonify({"error": "Unauthorized"}), 401
    users = User.query.all()
    return jsonify([user.to_dict() for user in users])

### Output (Summary + Deployment Steps):
This Flask backend API provides a JWT-protected endpoint for retrieving a list of users. SQLAlchemy is used to interact with a database, and basic token validation is implemented. To deploy this backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed (Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT).
2. Configure the database connection and initialize the database.
3. Set up the Flask app and register the routes.
4. Implement the token validation logic.
5. Deploy the app to a server or containerization platform (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
6. Configure the server/platform to handle incoming requests and serve the app.
7. Test the API endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly.
8. Monitor the app for performance and security issues, and make necessary adjustments as needed.

To automate the deployment process, consider using a tool like GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the app from a GitHub repository. This can include steps like building a Docker image, pushing it to a registry like Docker Hub, and deploying it to a staging environment for testing before promoting it to production.
