Based on this project, generate a Dockerfile:

Summary:

You are an expert DevOps engineer.

The following is a software release description and a piece of code.

Your job is to:
1. Summarize what the code does in plain English.
2. Identify key deployment-relevant features (e.g., use of Flask, JWT, SQLAlchemy).
3. Suggest how such a backend could be deployed.

### Release Notes:
This file simulates a basic Flask backend API and includes:

A JWT-protected endpoint.

A reference to a SQLAlchemy model (User).

Basic token validation.

### Code:
# backend/app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from models import User
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not token or not validate_token(token):
        return jsonify({"error": "Unauthorized"}), 401
    users = User.query.all()
    return jsonify([user.to_dict() for user in users])

### Output (Summary + Deployment Steps):
This Flask backend API provides a JWT-protected endpoint for retrieving a list of users. SQLAlchemy is used to interact with a database, and basic token validation is implemented. To deploy this backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed (Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT).
2. Configure the database connection and initialize the database.
3. Set up the Flask app and register the routes.
4. Implement the token validation logic.
5. Deploy the app to a server or containerization platform (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
6. Configure the server/platform to handle incoming requests and serve the app.
7. Test the API endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly.
8. Monitor the app for performance and security issues, and make necessary adjustments as needed.

To create a Dockerfile for this backend, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for the Dockerfile and the backend code.
2. Copy the backend code into the new directory.
3. Create a new file called Dockerfile in the new directory.
4. Add the following lines to the Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

5. Save and close the Dockerfile.
6. Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t my-backend .

7. Run the Docker container using the following command:

docker run -p 5000:5000 my-backend

8. Test the API endpoints by sending requests to the container's exposed port (5000).

Note: Remember to replace "my-backend" in the Docker commands with a unique name for your container.
